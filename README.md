Inverted Hebrew for Factorio 0.11.22

Inverting hebrew text in the original base & core files so that it's displayed R-T-L visually as well as logically.

About me: I'm an Israeli IT manager, self-employed, got-too-much-time-on-my-hands kinda guy, that got so taken by Factorio's ( http://www.factorio.com ) charm that I decided to devote my free time to improve it by fixing the R-T-L problem with Hebrew translation in the game (check out http://www.factorioforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=12235 for more information). I've also messed with KSP's rover wheel's (to make them more resilient, because I didn't like that they break on every impact :D )

This project was started on june 20, 2015 on my laptop as a test of my ability to make the needed changes and actualy mod Factorio. It seams to work... so I will continue the work until such time as the game will be able to correctly present the Hebrew R-T-L without inverting the translation file lines
